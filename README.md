## Database

H2 is one of the popular in memory databases. Spring Boot has very good integration for H2.
H2 is a relational database management system written in Java. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode.
H2 supports a sub set of the SQL standard.
H2 also provides a web console to maintain the database.

## Swagger-UI
Swagger 2 is an open-source project used to describe and document RESTful APIs. Swagger 2 is language-agnostic and is extensible into new technologies and protocols beyond HTTP. The current version defines a set HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets to dynamically generate documentation from a Swagger-compliant API. These files are bundled by the Swagger UI project to display the API on the browser. Besides rendering documentation, Swagger UI allows other API developers or consumers to interact with the APIâ€™s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

The Swagger 2 specification, which is known as OpenAPI specification, has several implementations. Currently, Springfox that has replaced Swagger-SpringMVC (Swagger 1.2 and older) is popular for Spring Boot applications. Springfox supports both Swagger 1.2 and 2.0.
